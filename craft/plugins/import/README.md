Import plugin for Craft CMS
=================

Plugin that allows you to import data from CSV files.

Usage
=================
Importing data is a two step process:

Step 1. Select import options
- Choose the type of element to import (Category, Entry, or User)
- Select the corresponding category group, section, entry type, or user group
- Select the Import Behavior:
    - Append Data — Will add new categories, entries, or users.
    - Replace Data — Will update data for existing matched categories, entries, or users.
    - Delete Data — Will delete data for existing matched categories, entries, or users.

Step 2. Map CSV data
- Map the destination fields for the CSV data.
- Select which fields will be used as criteria to match existing records to replace (update) or delete data.

And import!

Features
=================
 - Import Entries, Users and Categories
 - Map CSV columns onto Fields

 - Has a hook "registerImportOptionPaths" to allow special field types to have a custom option (or options) in the mapping select menu.
 - Has a hook "modifyImportRow" to allow special field types to customize data just before it gets imported.
 - Has events "onImportFinish" and "onBeforeImportDelete"
   - These will notify you when the import finishes or wants to delete an element
 - Uses the Task service to import while you work on.
 - Automatically detects CSV delimiters
 - Will connect Entries (also Structures), Categories, Users and Assets by searching for them
 - Will send a summary email when the task if finished
 - View your import history

###Roadmap###
 - Import more ElementTypes (Tags, Globals, Assets?) (0.8)
 - Support JSON and XML (0.9)

Important:
=================
The plugin's folder should be named "import"

Frequently Asked Questions
=================
- How do I indicate an element field type in the CSV file?
	- Import utilizes "search", so it can be anything that makes it unique
- How would I indicate a multiplicity of element field types in the CSV file?
	- Just separate them by comma
- How should I write my CSVs so parent & child entries/categories work properly?
	- Write it like Ancestor/Child/Entry and connect as "Ancestor". Do note that "Entries in this section have their own URLs" should be checked.
- Do parent entries already need to exist before I import a CSV? Or can they be created form the came CSV import as their child entries?
	- The entry should exist, but if it comes in the row before then it will exist and it will pass.
- Is there an "Export" feature so I can get to data that is more complete in the DB than in my CSV file?
	- No, but there is the "Export" plugin that can be found here: https://github.com/boboldehampsink/export

Hooks
=================
### modifyImportRow

Manipulate the data as the import is running. You'll be able to tweak your data just before it goes into the database.

This code example is a good starting point:

```php
/**
 * Modify data just before importing
 *
 * @param BaseElementModel $element  The current element receiving import data.
 * @param array            $map      Mapping of data between CSV -> Craft fields.
 * @param array            $data     Raw data provided for this row.
 */
public function modifyImportRow($element, $map, $data)
{
    // Map data to fields
    $fields = array_combine($map, $data);

    // Initialize content array
    $content = array();

    // Arrange your content in a way that makes sense for your plugin
    foreach ($fields as $handle => $value) {
        $content[$handle] = $value;
    }

    // Set modified content
    $element->setContentFromPost($content);
}
```

The `foreach` loop is probably where you'll do the most customizing. However, feel free to edit any (or all) of this method to achieve your desired results.

### registerImportOptionPaths

Prep the field mapping before the import is run. This allows you to customize the `<select>` menu option(s) for your field.

When you are mapping your CSV columns to Craft fields, Import let's you choose which field you want to assign your data to. There is a `<select>` menu with a list of Craft fields, and you select the destination for each column.

The purpose of this hook is to give you the opportunity to replace the standard `<option>` tag with something custom. In essence, you are providing a template which contains a custom `<option>` (or multiple options) to handle the data mapping in a way that is more preferable for your field type.

Put this in your main MyPlugin.php file, and edit accordingly:

```php
/**
 * For custom field types, replace default <option> with custom HTML
 *
 * @return array  Mapping between custom field type -> custom <option> template
 */
public function registerImportOptionPaths()
{
    return array(
        'MyPlugin_MyFieldType' => 'myplugin/customImportOption.html',
    );
}
```

You are being given the opportunity to say "for fields of this type, use my custom template in place of the default `<option>` tag". Make sure your `customImportOption.html` template outputs one or more `<option>` tags... They will be injected into the field select dropdown menu.

In summary:

 1. Create a short template to replace the default `<option>`
 2. Map that template to your field type with this hook
